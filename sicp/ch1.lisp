;; some additional thoughts:
;; - don't use any zeroes!
;; - just have the actual visible numbers
;; - we can get the (car) and (last (car)) of each "line" and figure out whether to use zero
;; - maybe do something like: 1st and last are always 1
;; therefore, just grab everything (butfirst) and (butlast)  (intersection (cdr) (butlast))
